    - Dear Friends,
    - Thank you all so much for your ...
    - care and concern
    - mean a lot to me
    - in a few days' time
    - to tell the truth
    - be sick to death of
    - daytime TV
    - complain about how busy we are with overtime and meetings and everything
    - Anyway, I hope you're all well.
    - Thanks again and I hope to see you all very soon.
    - actually
    - boredom
    - get back on my feet
 - formal way   
    - I trust
    - agony agonising
    - monotonous monotony
    - express displeasure
    - eagerly anticipate
    - in the very near future
