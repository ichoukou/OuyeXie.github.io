Variable length pattern matching in versions 2.1.x and earlier does not enforce relationship uniqueness for patterns described inside of a single MATCH clause. This means that a query such as the following: MATCH (a)-[r]→(b), (a)-[rs*]→(c) RETURN may include r as part of the rs set. This behavior has changed in versions 2.2.0 and later, in such a way that r will be excluded from the result set, as this better adheres to the rules of relationship uniqueness as documented here Uniqueness. If you have a query pattern that needs to retrace relationships rather than ignoring them as the relationship uniqueness rules normally dictate, you can accomplish this using multiple match clauses, as follows: MATCH (a)-[r]→(b) MATCH (a)-[rs]→(c) RETURN *. This will work in all versions of Neo4j that support the MATCH clause, namely 2.0.0 and later.
