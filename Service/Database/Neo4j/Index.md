        - Schema indexes can only do exact matches right now. Your "testid" in n.sourceIds does not use the index (as shown by your query times). I think there are plans to make this behave better, but I'm waiting for them just as eagerly as you are.

        - The index framework just calls toString() on indexed values that are not ValueContexts. So you should find a suitable representation of your arrays (e.g. a comma separated list or a json array string) if you want to lookup them. And then index that representation.
