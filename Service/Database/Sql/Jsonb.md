# How to query within jsonb:

```
select * from users where wx_info @> '{"nickname":"Seth"}';
```

@> means "Does the left JSON value contain within it the right value?"

```
select * from users where wx_info ï¼Ÿ 'nickname';
```

jsonb also has an existence operator, which is a variation on the theme of containment: it tests whether a string (given as a text value) appears as an object key or array element at the top level of the jsonb value.
