    - It’s common for people to have a low credit score and still be responsible about money. Maybe they haven’t worked on their credit history to correct past mistakes or they went through divorce, relocation, sickness, or youthful overindulgence in credit. Employers know how to read all the figures in a credit history. They look for indicators of ongoing financial instability that represent a risk to them on some level.
    - Order a copy of your credit report and make sure it does not contain mistakes. You may unknowingly be a victim of identity theft. Also, you can work to minimize black marks in your history by attaching letters of explanation.

    - Credit checks will only apply if your looking for a job in the financial markets, they want to know that you are good with money. It is very important to pay your bills consistently before the due dates. If it`s not possible to make payments call to make arrangements so you don`t get red flagged by the company.

    - This also generally looks for credit worthiness. If it is a higher level job or if you have been on the market long they will look at what your credit looks like, if there are red flags, etc. If you are making good money for the area you are in but are in debt up to your eyeballs and have past due bills and a bankruptcy, there could be something there that is a red flag to the company. Now if you are a college student and in the same situation, that might be considered normal, so nothing to worry about.

    - Two of every three employers say they gave candidates an opportunity to explain their credit histories before making a hiring decision.
      Nonetheless, credit checks remain a component of hiring, especially for positions with significant financial responsibilities. According to the Society of Human Resource Management, your credit is most likely to be checked if you're seeking:
      A job that involves handling cash, banking or accounting.
      A position that provides access to confidential employee information.
      A senior executive role that carries lots of decision-making responsibility.

    - Liens - Any type of lien against you could be a sign of irresponsibility. It suggests to employers that you weren't responsible enough to pay off your debt or negotiate a settlement.
    - 100% Credit Utilization - This shows employers that you're in over your head and can't stick to a budget.
    - Bankruptcy/Foreclosure - Again this shows a lack of responsibility with things you're committed to. To an employer this could suggest that you'll bail on large projects and aren't resourceful enough. It also may suggest that you don't have long term visibility.
    - Recent Late Fees - Recent 30, 60, or 90 day late fees show finances are causing you significant stress. This activity may appear as more of a red flag for financial positions because it suggests you have trouble budgeting.
    - Significant Activity - A recent opening of several new accounts or closing of several accounts could appear as a red flag. Significant new activity may trigger employees to think you are desperate and need extra credit because you are in over your head. Closing several accounts could appear as a sign that you aren't good with money and don't know how to avoid charging up a large sum of debt.

    - The privacy concerns relating to credit history checks are similar to those arising when collecting and using information related to a candidate’s criminal record. Requiring that candidates consent to a credit history check may be unlawful in those jurisdictions in which limits are imposed on the scope of pre-employment inquiries to what is reasonable in the circumstances. Employers who are hiring in these jurisdictions should carefully evaluate whether the credit information it seeks is reasonably related to the position for which the applicant is being considered.

    - Background, credit, criminal records checks, and drivers abstract checks should be done only if they are relevant to the position, and only if you are being seriously considered for the position, i.e. not at the initial application stage (for more information see SAS Inc., Investigation Report P2005-IR-008).
