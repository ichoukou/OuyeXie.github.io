# Questions

 - In note "货币供需影响利率", interest rate is affected by supply and demand of money. The question is how Federal Reserve or Central Bank can set or adjust interest rate as it wants?
    - they do not decide, they just affect it by lending more or less money out, which will then set the new equilibrium interest rate due the shift of supply curve. (check 货币和财政政策)
    - check "IS-LM模型的LM部分", "IS-LM模型的LM部分"
 - IOU???
    - I owe you???
 - Canada's foreign reserves?
