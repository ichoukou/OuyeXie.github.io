            - contemporaneous price (同期价格)
    - Arbitrage
        - Pi of alpha = Pi of beta * (D of alpha in period 2/ D of beta in period 2)
            - Pie: price
            - D: product or output
    - nominal interest rate: i
        - Price this year = price next year / (1+i)
    - real interest rate: r
        - p1 / p2 = 1 + r 
            - p2: the <b>present value</b> of good 2

        - no-arbitrage
            - looking through the veil
