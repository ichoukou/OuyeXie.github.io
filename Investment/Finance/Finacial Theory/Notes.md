    - endowment
    - general equilibrium
    - indifference curve
 - 均衡计算
    - welfare function
    - the theory of equilibrium
        - exogenous -> endogenous
        - add financial variables later
    - marginal utility of x / Px = marginal utility of y /Py
    - these equations always have a solution
    - interaction, but rational interaction
 - 效率、资产和时间
    - equilibrium maximise the sum of utility
        - the sum of utility is concave
    - Pareto Efficiency
        - weaken the definition of equilibrium
    - Fundamental Theorem of Economics
        - 1st Welfare Theorem of Economics
        - agent rationality`
    - externalities
    - diminishing marginal utility <-> increasing marginal utility
        - one or two tickets
    - why should not financial market be efficient?
        - credit market
    - FINANCE
        - time / impatience
            - think good y as the same as good x but one period later
        - risk
        - assets
            - the essence of asset is that it is something that you hold today because later it will deliver you money or goods or something

        - ===============================================================
        - credit / interest rate / return / collateral
            - Px / Py = 1 + real interest rate
        - money
        - bank / institution
        - capital
        - contract
 - 现值价格和实际利率
    - discount factor
        - relatively impatient
    - perfect foresight    
    - Marx's view
        - rate of interest is determined by the rate of profit
    - Financial Equilibrium
        - can to transferred into a general equilibrium
    - Stock 
        - forecast what it is going to produce
        - the anticipated dividend of stock alpha = the output since that is the end of the world of stock alpha in period n
    - Inflation
        - q2 / q1
            - price of apple in period 2/ price of apple in period 1
            - contemporaneous price (同期价格)
    - Arbitrage
        - Pi of alpha = Pi of beta * (D of alpha in period 2/ D of beta in period 2)
            - Pie: price
            - D: product or output
    - nominal interest rate: i
        - Price this year = price next year / (1+i)
    - real interest rate: r
        - p1 / p2 = 1 + r 
            - p2: the <b>present value</b> of good 2
    - Selling short / Naked selling
        - selling something you do not even have
        - making a promise without collateral
    - Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing
        - the price of a stock today = Pi of alpha / q1 = D of alpha in period 2 / (1+r)
