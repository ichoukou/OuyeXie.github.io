# leadership principles

Explain how you have embodied these principles in your own experiences. You will want to tell stories from your experiences which speak to these. Try to avoid using the same examples throughout your interviews; it is important that we see the breadth of your work and results
  
 - Customer Obsession:
    - Leaders start with the customer and work backwards.
 - Frugality
    - Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness,
 - Invent and Simplify
    - Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.
 - Bias for Action
    - Speed matters in business.
 - Hire and Develop “The Best”
    - Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion.
 - Are Right, A Lot
    - Leaders are right a lot.
 - Ownership
    - Leaders are owners.
 - Learn and Be Curious
    - Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves.
 - Think Big
    - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
 - Dive Deep
    - Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, and audit frequently.
 - Earn Trust of Others
    - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully.
 - Insist on the Highest Standards
    - Leaders have relentlessly high standards.
 - Deliver Results
    - Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion.
 - Have Backbone
    - Disagree and Commit: Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting.

# Problem Solving

 - We want to know how you deal with ambiguity and break complex problems into manageable parts.
 - We are looking for candidates to show the natural ability and initiative to ask clarifying questions before they begin to solve the problem
 - Thinking out loud during your interview is not required, but it will help the interviewers understand your thoughts, which will allow them to help you along the way. 
 - If you get stuck during your interviews, listen for and take advantage of the hints that the interviewers may provide to guide you to a successful solution.
 
# Miscellaneous Tips

 - When answering questions, be as concise and detailed in your response as possible. The STAR (situation, task, action, result) method is recommended.
 - We want to hear your answers in terms of “I” rather than “we” so that we understand your individual impact versus that of your team.
 - Amazon is a very data and results driven company. We make decisions with data whenever possible. Each of your examples should include the data you used in your decision making and what the results were.
 - Amazon values candidates who are self-aware of their failures. Do not be afraid to talk about your mistakes and how you’ve learned from them. We want to know what actions you have taken to ensure your mistakes will not happen again.
 - Amazon gives employees autonomy. Provide examples of areas where you have taken initiative without another person’s direction or input.
 - Be ready to discuss the Amazon products and/or technologies that excite you. While we do not expect you to know every detail about the team you are interviewing with, you should research the team and product enough to be able to have a thorough conversation with the interviewers on those topics.

# Coding

 - Expect to write syntactically correct code
 - Make sure to check for edge cases and validate that no bad input can slip through

//TODO
# Algorithms

 - Consider reviewing traversals, searching, divide and conquer, and other common algorithms.
    - traversals
    - searching
    - divide
    - conquer
    - other common algorithms
 - Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms is more important than memorizing the specific details of any given algorithm.
 - When discussing algorithms problems, it is also important to show your work and thought process.
 
# Data Structures

 - You will be expected to understand the inner workings of common data structures and be able to compare and contrast their usage in various applications.
    - Map
        - HashTable
        - HashMap
            - LinkedHashMap
        - SortedMap
            - TreeMap
        - WeakHashMap
        - IdentityHashMap
    - Collection
        - Set
            - HashSet
                - LinkedHashSet
            - SortedSet
                - TreeSet

        - Queue
            - Deque
                - LinkedList
            - PriorityQueue
 - You will be expected to know the runtimes for common operations, as well as how they use memory.
 
# Object-Oriented Design
 
 //TODO
 - You should have a working knowledge of a few common and useful design patterns, 
 - as well as know how to write software in an object-oriented way with the appropriate use of inheritance and aggregation.
    - encapsulation
        - Binding the data with the code that manipulates it.
        - It keeps the data and the code safe from external interference
        - Everyone knows how to access it.
        - Can be easily used regardless of implementation details.
        - There shouldn’t any side effects of the code, to the rest of the application.
    - Inheritance
        - Inheritance is the mechanism by which an object acquires the some/all properties of another object.
        - It supports the concept of hierarchical classification.
    - Polymorphism
        - Polymorphism means to process objects differently based on their data type.
        - In other words it means, one method with multiple implementation, for a certain class of action. And which implementation to be used is decided at runtime depending upon the situation (i.e., data type of the object)
        - This can be implemented by designing a generic interface, which provides generic methods for a certain class of action and there can be multiple classes, which provides the implementation of these generic methods.
        - Overloading in simple words means two methods having same method name but takes different input parameters. This called static because, which method to be invoked will be decided at the time of compilation
        - Overriding means a derived class is implementing a method of its super class.
    - Abstraction
        - which can be managed by the help of its subsystems, even if their inner details are unknown.
    - [OOPs in Java- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction](http://beginnersbook.com/2013/03/oops-in-java-encapsulation-inheritance-polymorphism-abstraction/)
 - You won’t be tested on how specific design patterns work, but expect to be able to defend your design choices.
 
# System Design

 - it is important to have an understanding of a few basic system design concepts. Examples include service oriented architecture, caching, and multi-tiered architecture
 - If you are suggesting technology to solve a problem, please make sure you understand how that technology works
 - how your solution solves the problem than specific technology solutions
 - Steps
    - ask questoins
    - write down requirements
    - design
    - trade off
    - operation performance

 - multi-tiered architecture
    - Synonyms n-tier architecture ; Multi-layered architecture Definition A Multi-tier Architecture is a software architecture in which different software components, organized in tiers (layers), provide dedicated functionality. The most common occurrence of a multi-tier architecture is a three-tier system consisting of a data management tier (mostly encompassing one or several database servers), an application tier (business logic) and a client tier (interface functionality)

    - [Multi-Tiered Architecture](http://www.softrip.com/services/multitierarch.aspx)
        - Client applications - The back-office for internal users, and the online reservation system. Since all these components are served by a web server, they can be easily load-balanced with your preferred LB solution.
        - Business Logic Layer - All business logic is contained in a Windows Service. Softrip developed our own custom load-balancing protocol for this layer, allowing for easy and quick scaling up and down of your system.
        - Database Layer - Softrip uses Microsoft SQL Server for data storage and retrieval. The database can be scaled using MSSQL's technologies

 - non-relational database
 - microservices
    - [Microservice架构模式简介](http://www.cnblogs.com/loveis715/p/4644266.html)
        - Monolith, 这种将所有的代码及功能都包含在一个WAR包中的项目组织方式被称为Monolith
        - 简单地说，Microservice架构模式就是将整个Web应用组织为一系列小的Web服务
        - 公共功能的处理, 但是这种方式为子服务增强了对权限系统的依赖性。和组件之间的耦合一样，增大的耦合性会导致服务的重用性下降。
        - 模型匹配, Microservice可能拥有不同的视角，进而造成了各个子服务中的对应模型并不匹配
        - 因此在集中的公共服务中，我们需要使用较为细粒度的模型。该细粒度模型需要具有较高的灵活性，以能够无损地表示各个服务中的相应模型。
        - 一个较为常见的麻烦就是保持多个子服务之间数据的一致性。我们知道，在服务中，保持一致性的工作常常是由事务来完成的。而如果希望在Microservice架构模式实现中保持子服务之间数据的一致性，我们可能就需要使用分布式事务了。
            - 异步机制来保持数据的一致性
        - Microservice架构模式中各个子服务的独立性也会导致一系列问题。最明显的就是需要多个子服务相互配合的情况。由于这些子服务是不同的进程，因此在这些进程之间保持数据的一致性，或添加一个新的跨子服务的用户用例实际上都是一件非常麻烦的事情。而且对这些独立服务在整个系统中是否能够工作的测试需要运行大量的集成测试。而如果需要快速地对这些子服务进行开发和迭代，那么我们就需要每个开发人员都能够专业并高效地使用一系列自动化工具。这实际上也是一个不低的要求.................
 - sharding
    - [分布式数据库概述](http://www.cnblogs.com/fineboy/archive/2005/08/03/206395.html)
        5．数据分片
        类型：
        （1）水平分片：按一定的条件把全局关系的所有元组划分成若干不相交的子集，每个子集为关系的一个片段。
        （2）垂直分片：把一个全局关系的属性集分成若干子集，并在这些子集上作投影运算，每个投影称为垂直分片。
        （3）导出分片：又称为导出水平分片，即水平分片的条件不是本关系属性的条件，而是其他关系属性的条件。
        （4）混合分片：以上三种方法的混合。可以先水平分片再垂直分片，或先垂直分片再水平分片，或其他形式，但他们的结果是不相同的。
        条件：
        （1）完备性条件：必须把全局关系的所有数据映射到片段中，决不允许有属于全局关系的数据却不属于它的任何一个片段。
        （2）可重构条件：必须保证能够由同一个全局关系的各个片段来重建该全局关系。对于水平分片可用并操作重构全局关系；对于垂直分片可用联接操作重构全局关系。
        （3）不相交条件：要求一个全局关系被分割后所得的各个数据片段互不重叠（对垂直分片的主键除外）。

        - 一致性可理解为所有节点都能访问到最新版本的数据，这在单机场景下非常容易实现，使用共享内存和锁即可解决，但数据存储在单机会有两个限制：1）单机不可 用系统整体将不可用；2）系统吞吐量受限于单机的计算能力
        - Paxos协议提出只要系统中2f+1个节点中的f+1个节点可用，那么系统整体就可用并且能保证数据的强一致性
        - ZooKeeper的ZAB协议把Paxos更加简化，并提供全局时序保证，使得Paxos能够广泛应用到工业场景

# Databases

 - The more you know about how relational and non-relational databases work and what tradeoffs exist between them, the better prepared you will be.
    - [非关系型数据库和关系型数据库区别，优势比较？](https://www.zhihu.com/question/24225007)
        - 传统的SQL数据库有3个缺点
            - 许可费用昂贵
            - 不能自动Sharding
            - 严格的Schema
        - 非关系型数据库的优势：
            1. 性能
            NOSQL是基于键值对的，可以想象成表中的主键和值的对应关系，而且不需要经过SQL层的解析，所以性能非常高。
            2. 可扩展性
            同样也是因为基于键值对，数据之间没有耦合性，所以非常容易水平扩展。
        - 关系型数据库的优势：
            1. 复杂查询
            可以用SQL语句方便的在一个表以及多个表之间做非常复杂的数据查询。
            2. 事务支持
            使得对于安全性能很高的数据访问要求得以实现。
    - acid, 原子性（Atomicity）、一致性（Consistency）、隔离性（Isolation）、持久性（Durability, 一个支持事务（Transaction）的数据库，必需要具有这四种特性

    - workflow systems
        - AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.
        - Amazon Kinesis is a platform for streaming data on AWS, offering powerful services to make it easy to load and analyze streaming data, and also providing the ability for you to build custom streaming data applications for specialized needs. Web applications, mobile devices, wearables, industrial sensors, and many software applications and services can generate staggering amounts of streaming data – sometimes TBs per hour – that need to be collected, stored, and processed continuously. Amazon Kinesis services enable you to do that simply and at a low cost.

            - layer 7 也即在应用层做负载均衡
            - 很多情况下，load balancer所虚拟的服务是有状态的，这意味着来自同一客户的请求应发送给同一个backend server，否则会话信息就乱掉了。
              对于layer-4的来说，通常根据源ip地址来实现affinity。
              对于layer-7的来说，如果traffic是http的，通常的做法是基于cookie的，即将状态信息放入cookie中，不过这当然也有一些限制。
