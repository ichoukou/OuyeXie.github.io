# leadership principles

Explain how you have embodied these principles in your own experiences. You will want to tell stories from your experiences which speak to these. Try to avoid using the same examples throughout your interviews; it is important that we see the breadth of your work and results
  
 - Customer Obsession:
    - Leaders start with the customer and work backwards.
 - Frugality
    - Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness,
 - Invent and Simplify
    - Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always  nd ways to simplify.
 - Bias for Action
    - Speed matters in business.
 - Hire and Develop “ e Best”
    - Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion.
 - Are Right, A Lot
    - Leaders are right a lot.
 - Ownership
    - Leaders are owners.
 - Learn and Be Curious
    - Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves.
 -  Think Big
    - Thinking small is a self-ful lling prophecy.
 - Dive Deep
    - Leaders operate at all levels, stay con- nected to the details, and audit frequently.
 - Earn Trust of Others
    - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully.
 - Insist on the Highest Standards
    - Leaders have relentlessly high standards.
 - Deliver Results
    - Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion.
 - Have Backbone
    - Disagree and Commit: Leaders are obli- gated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting.

# Problem Solving

 - We want to know how you deal with ambiguity and break complex problems into manageable parts.
 - We are looking for candidates to show the natural ability and initiative to ask clarifying questions before they begin to solve the problem
 - Thinking out loud during your interview is not required, but it will help the interviewers understand your thoughts, which will allow them to help you along the way. 
 - If you get stuck during your interviews, listen for and take advantage of the hints that the interviewers may provide to guide you to a successful solution.
 
# Miscellaneous Tips

 - When answering questions, be as concise and detailed in your response as possible. The STAR (situation, task, action, result) method is recommended.
 - We want to hear your answers in terms of “I” rather than “we” so that we understand your individual impact versus that of your team.
 - Amazon is a very data and results driven company. We make decisions with data whenever possible. Each of your examples should include the data you used in your decision making and what the results were.
 - Amazon values candidates who are self-aware of their failures. Do not be afraid to talk about your mistakes and how you’ve learned from them. We want to know what actions you have taken to ensure your mistakes will not happen again.
 - Amazon gives employees autonomy. Provide examples of areas where you have taken initiative without another person’s direction or input.
 - Be ready to discuss the Amazon products and/or technologies that excite you. While we do not expect you to know every detail about the team you are interviewing with, you should research the team and product enough to be able to have a thorough conversation with the interviewers on those topics.

# Coding

 - Expect to write syntactically correct code
 - Make sure to check for edge cases and validate that no bad input can slip through
 
# Algorithms

 - Consider reviewing traversals, searching, divide and conquer, and other common algorithms.
    - traversals
    - searching
    - divide
    - conquer
    - other common algorithms
 - Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms is more important than memorizing the specific details of any given algorithm.
 - When discussing algorithms problems, it is also important to show your work and thought process.
 
# Data Structures

 - You will be expected to understand the inner workings of common data structures and be able to compare and contrast their usage in various applications.
 - You will be expected to know the runtimes for common operations, as well as how they use memory.
 
# Object-Oriented Design
 - You should have a working knowledge of a few common and useful design patterns, 
 - as well as know how to write software in an object-oriented way with the appropriate use of inheritance and aggregation.
 - You won’t be tested on how specific design patterns work, but expect to be able to defend your design choices.
 
# System Design

 - it is important to have an understanding of a few basic system design concepts. Examples include service oriented architecture, caching, and multi-tiered architecture
 - If you are suggesting technology to solve a problem, please make sure you understand how that technology works
 - how your solution solves the problem than specific technology solutions
 - Steps
    - ask questoins
    - write down requirements
    - design
    - trade off
    - operation performance
 
 - service oriented architecture
 - caching
 - multi-tiered architecture
 
 - SOA
 - distributed system
 - load balancing
 - non-relational database
 - microservices
 - sharding
 - trade off availability, consistency
   
# Operating Systems
 
 - you should be familiar with some topics that can impact code performance, such as memory management, synchronization, paging, and
   multithreading.
    - memory management
    - synchronization
    - paging
    - multithreading

# Databases

 - The more you know about how relational and non-relational databases work and what tradeoffs exist between them, the better prepared you will be.
 
# Distributed Computing

 - Having an understanding of topics such as workflow systems, map-reduce, distributed caching schemes, and load balancing can help you formulate answers to some of the more complicated distributed architecture questions you might encounter.
    - workflow systems
    - map-reduce
    - distributed caching schemes
    - load balancing
    
# Client Development

 - The development of these client applications can require familiarity with graphics libraries, computational geometry, hardware integration, content protection schemes, and System Development Kit (SDK) design.
