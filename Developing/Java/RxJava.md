 - [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
    - RxJava is a Java VM implementation of Reactive Extensions: a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
        - [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io)
            - An API for asynchronous programming with observable streams
    - It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to 
    compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures.
        - [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
            - The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
