 - [Design Patterns in Java Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/)
    - Creational Patterns   
        - Factory pattern
        - Abstract Factory patterns
        - Singleton pattern
        - Builder pattern
        - Prototype pattern
            - cloneable interface
            - Hashtable
    - Structural Patterns
        - Adapter pattern
        - Bridge Pattern
            - decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
            - This pattern involves an interface which acts as a bridge which makes the functionality of concrete classes independent from interface implementer classes
        - Filter pattern or Criteria pattern
        - Composite pattern
            - This pattern creates a class that contains group of its own objects
        - Decorator pattern
            - This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact
        - Facade pattern
        - Flyweight pattern
            - similar to our logFactory
        - Proxy pattern
            - we create object having original object to interface its functionality to outer world
    - Behavioral Patterns
        - Chain of Responsibility Pattern
        - Command pattern
            - ```public class BuyStock implements Order { private Stock abcStock;```
        - Interpreter pattern
            - This pattern involves implementing an expression interface which tells to interpret a particular context. This pattern is used in SQL parsing, symbol processing engine etc.
        - Iterator pattern
        - Mediator pattern
            - provides a mediator class which normally handles all the communications between different classes and supports easy maintenance of the code by loose coupling
        - Memento pattern
            - Memento contains state of an object to be restored. Originator creates and stores states in Memento objects and Caretaker object is responsible to restore object state from Memento
        - Observer pattern
            - Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified
            - Subject is an object having methods to attach and detach observers to a client object
        - State pattern
            - we create objects which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes
        - Null Object pattern
            - Null Object reflects a do nothing relationship. Such Null object can also be used to provide default behaviour in case data is not available
    - J2EE Patterns
