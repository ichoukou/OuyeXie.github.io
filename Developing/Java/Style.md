- Checkstyle
        - configurable set of automated rules to enforce syntax and style at build time
        - WDT build logic has a working example: https://code.888.com/packages/WDTAntBuildLogic/trees/mainline
       
- Immutable state
        - "final" modifier in Java
       
- Program to the interface
        - Declare variables by interface rather than concrete class
       
- Defensive programming
        - Throw exceptions on null, rather than handing those unacceptable
        - Fail fast and loud
       
- design patterns

-        by Erich Gamma  (Author), Richard Helm  (Author), Ralph Johnson  (Author), John Vlissides  (Author)
- code review
        - Should be about “how the problem is solved”
- tests
        - Same level of rigor as source code!
- IDE setup (Eclipse and InteliJ)

 - checkStyle
 - clean code
 - reusable software
 
 - utility class
 - final 
 - interface
 - null check
 - java 8 null -> object
 - config
    - builder
 
 - does it work? <-> how it works?
