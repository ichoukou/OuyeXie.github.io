- Some useful notes
    - Checkstyle
        - configurable set of automated rules to enforce syntax and style at build time
        - WDT build logic has a working example: https://code.888.com/packages/WDTAntBuildLogic/trees/mainline
           
    - Immutable state
        - "final" modifier in Java
           
    - Program to the interface
        - Declare variables by interface rather than concrete class
           
    - Defensive programming
        - Throw exceptions on null, rather than handing those unacceptable
        - Fail fast and loud
           
    - design patterns
        - Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software 1st Edition - by Erich Gamma  (Author), 
            Richard Helm  (Author), Ralph Johnson  (Author), John Vlissides  (Author)
    - code review
        - Should be about “how the problem is solved”
    - tests
        - Same level of rigor as source code!
    - IDE setup (Eclipse and InteliJ)

- Some recommended books
    - checkStyle
    - clean code
    - reusable software
